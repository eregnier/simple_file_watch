# Simple file watch

## Guide

this program makes it simple to watch for file change in a directory and trigger an action accordingly

here is how to use it :

```bash
Usage: 
  --help, -h : Show help
  --run-command, -x : Command to run on file change
  --ignore-folder, -ifo : Comma separated list of folders to ignore
  --ignore-file, -ifi : Comma separated list of files to ignore
  --watch-folder, -w : Folder to watch
  --sleep, -s : Sleep duration between checks
  --debug, -d : Enable debug mode
```

exemple:

```bash
go run main.go -x "python3 on_file_change.py" -w test  -ifo "test/node_modules,test/owi" -ifi "folder1,folder3"  -s 100
```

This command listen for test folder. if a file change in it, the `python3 on_file_change.py` command is ran.

All file changes are sent to the target program in a `SIMPLE_FILE_WATCH_CHANGES` environment variable

for exemple if `on_file_change.py` contains the following code :

```python
import os
print(os.environ.get('SIMPLE_FILE_WATCH_CHANGES'))
#[{"absolute_path":"test/updated_file.csv","operation":"changed"}]
```

when a file change in test folder, the result is to print the changed file from this folder

change environment variable is a json structure. operation can be one of changed | added | removed

This program is made to be simple yet quite efficient / lightweight to use.

You can exclude a comma separated list of file or directory using -ifi or -ifo accordingly (see exemple above)

debug option (-d) will help you check if the watch configuration works as expected.

## Build

```bash
go build main.go
strip main #Â optional. this reduce the binary file size from 2.6MB to 1.7MB
```
